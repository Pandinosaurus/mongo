/**
 * decreasing_election_timeout.js
 *
 * Test that election timeout can be decreased via reconfig and that the election timeout callback
 * is rescheduled accordingly.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Start a 2-node replica set with a large electionTimeoutMillis (default) and election log
 *    verbosity set to 5.
 * 2. Wait for log: "Scheduled election timeout callback" (should be far in the future).
 * 3. Reconfig to set electionTimeoutMillis to 1000 ms (1 second).
 * 4. Wait for logs:
 *    - "Canceling election timeout callback and not rescheduling"
 *    - "Rescheduled election timeout callback"
 * 5. Step down primary with force:true.
 * 6. Wait for secondary to become primary (should be <2s).
 *
